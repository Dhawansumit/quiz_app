## Architecture and Principles
**CLEAN Architecture**
This project follows CLEAN architecture to ensure separation of concerns and scalability. The structure is divided into three main layers:

**Data Layer**: Contains the implementation of data sources and repositories. It handles data fetching and storage.
**Domain Layer**: Contains business logic. This includes entities, use cases, and repository interfaces.
**Presentation Layer**: Handles the UI and state management. This includes widgets, pages, and BLoC classes.

**SOLID Principles**
The project adheres to SOLID principles to ensure maintainable and scalable code:

**Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has a single responsibility.
**Open/Closed Principle**: Classes are open for extension but closed for modification.
**Liskov Substitution Principle**: Subtypes can replace their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
**Interface Segregation Principle**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
**Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

## State Management
State management is handled using flutter_bloc. BLoC (Business Logic Component) helps separate business logic from the UI, making the code more modular and testable.

## Dependency Injection
The project uses get_it for dependency injection. get_it is a simple service locator for Dart and Flutter projects. It allows easy management of dependencies and promotes a decoupled codebase.

## Navigation with AutoRoute
Navigation is managed using auto_route, a Flutter routing package that simplifies the management of routes. It allows for declarative routing and code generation for better navigation management.

## Running the Project
**Running the Builder**
Before running the project, ensure the necessary code generation steps are completed. Run the following command to generate the routes:

    flutter packages pub run build_runner build

**Running the Project**
To run the project, use the following command:

    flutter run

This will start the application on your connected device or emulator.


**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the use of CLEAN architecture, SOLID principles, state management with flutter_bloc, dependency injection with get_it, and navigation with auto_route in a Flutter application. It provides a modular and scalable structure for building robust applications.

Feel free to contribute to the project or use it as a reference for your own Flutter applications. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
